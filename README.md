- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @hungofhydra
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a huge fan of astronomy, and an expert in cosmology and astrophysics. Self-taught though so I don't have any degree.
I mainly play strategic games such as Final Fantasy, Super Robot War, Persona, Shin Megami Tensei, and Visual Novel. 
I'm also a vivid mecha fan, you can talk to me about most of the mecha IP there, my favorites are Shin Mazinger Zero and Getter Robot Armageddon.
I read manga, light novels, visual novels, and watch anime.
I use English and Japanese aside from my mother language - Vietnamese.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working with Nodejs/ExpressJS and React
